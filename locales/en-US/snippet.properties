mozilla_non_profit=<b>Hello there:</b> We know you love Firefox, but did you know a non-profit called Mozilla built Firefox? Thanks to donations, Mozilla does a lot more than build this awesome browser. We teach people to code, fight for online privacy, and protect this amazing thing called the Web for future generations. Just a few times a year Mozilla asks for donations, and tens of thousands of people all over the world give. If they didn't, we couldn't do all this good stuff. <em>If everyone reading this chipped in just a few euros we could wrap this fundraiser up in under an hour. You can make a donation here. Thank you.</em>
